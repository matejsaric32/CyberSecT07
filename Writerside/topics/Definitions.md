# Definitions

## Need-to-Know (Compartmentalization) / Least Privilege
- **Need-to-Know:** Ensures individuals only access information necessary for their specific tasks, minimizing exposure to sensitive data.
- **Least Privilege:** Restricts user permissions to the minimum required for their job, reducing risks of unauthorized access.

## Separation of Duties
A security practice where critical tasks are divided among multiple individuals or roles to prevent fraud, errors, or abuse. Example: One person initiates a transaction, while another approves it.

## Job Rotation
Periodically rotating employees between roles to:
- Mitigate insider threats.
- Detect irregularities.
- Foster skill development and reduce dependency on a single individual.

## SLA (Service Level Agreement)
A contract between a service provider and a customer defining:
- Expected service levels.
- Performance metrics.
- Penalties for non-compliance.
- Roles and responsibilities.

## NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement)
A legal agreement that prohibits parties from sharing or using confidential information without authorization. Commonly used in employment and business agreements.

## Asset
Any valuable resource in an organization, such as:
- **Tangible Assets:** Hardware like servers, desktops, or laptops.
- **Intangible Assets:** Data, intellectual property, or software.

## Configuration Management
The process of maintaining consistent configurations across system components to ensure reliability, compliance, and minimal service disruptions.

## Change Management
A structured method for implementing IT system or process changes to:
- Minimize risks.
- Ensure proper reviews and approvals.
- Maintain service continuity.

## Patch Management
The systematic process of:
1. Identifying available software updates.
2. Testing updates for stability.
3. Deploying updates to address vulnerabilities, improve performance, and enhance functionality.

## Vulnerability Management
A proactive process for identifying, assessing, and mitigating security vulnerabilities in systems, networks, or applications.

## Sandboxing
A security technique for isolating applications or processes in a controlled environment. Used to:
- Test untrusted code.
- Prevent potential threats from affecting the host system.

## Honeypot / Honeynet
- **Honeypot:** A decoy system designed to attract and detect attackers by mimicking vulnerabilities.
- **Honeynet:** A network of honeypots for advanced monitoring and analysis of attacker behavior.

## JOA / MOU (Joint Operating Agreement / Memorandum of Understanding)
- **JOA:** A formal document outlining terms of cooperation between entities on a shared project or operation.
- **MOU:** A less formal agreement specifying mutual understandings and intentions.

## HA (High Availability)
A system design principle aimed at maximizing uptime and minimizing downtime through redundancy and failover mechanisms.

## FT (Fault Tolerance)
The ability of a system to continue functioning even when one or more components fail, achieved through redundancy or alternative mechanisms.

## BCDR (Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery)
- **Business Continuity (BC):** Ensures uninterrupted operations during and after disruptions.
- **Disaster Recovery (DR):** Focuses on restoring critical systems and data following a major incident.
